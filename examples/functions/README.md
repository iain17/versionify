# Functions

This is the most basic and easy example. This example showcases how you can version you functions!

## Run the example

```bash
    go run main.go 
```

This will output:

````
my name is George
Farewell godspeed.
```

Notice how it output George, instead of Iain. Also the goodbye method defined in version one exists in version 2.
